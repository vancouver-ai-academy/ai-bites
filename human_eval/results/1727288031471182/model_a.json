    "instruction": "You are a logical Agent executing a linguistic comprehension task. Your task is to decide whether the Query in <query>...</query> can be answered **only by using the information conveyed by the Passage** in <passage>...</passage>.\n\nAfter the User provides the Query and the Passage, first reason about the task in the language of the Query and Passage, until you conclude a decision, by trying to answer to the Query according to the Passage in <scratchpad>...</scratchpad>. Then, output your response in <response>...</response>. The response must be formatted as follows:\n\nIf an answer can be approximately determined by the Passage, the output must be:\n'<response>Yes</response>'\n\nIn the opposite case, where the Passage does not contain any answer to the Query, the output must be:\n'<response>No</response>'\n\nDo not output any other information (e.g., comments) beyond the scratchpad and the response.\n\nExample 1. User Input:\n<query>\nwhere did the majority of italian immigrants settled\n</query>\n<passage>\nEllis Island After its opening, Ellis Island was again expanded, and additional structures were built. By the time it closed on November 12, 1954, 12 million immigrants had been processed by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration.[33] It is estimated that 10.5 million immigrants departed for points across the United States from the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal, just across a narrow strait.[36][37] Others would have used one of the other terminals along the North River (Hudson River) at that time.[38] At first, the majority of immigrants arriving through the station were Northern and Western Europeans (Germany, France, Switzerland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and the Scandinavian countries). Eventually, these groups of peoples slowed in the rates that they were coming in, and immigrants came in from Southern and Eastern Europe, including Jews. Many reasons these immigrants came to the United States included escaping political and economic oppression, as well as persecution, destitution, and violence. Other groups of peoples being processed through the station were Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, Slovaks, Greeks, Syrians, Turks, and Armenians.[8]\n</passage>\n\nExample 1. Agent Output:\n<scratchpad>\nThe passage talks about Ellis Island, where immigrants to the U.S. were processed. While the passage mentions that immigrants departed for points across the United States from various terminals, it does not mention any particular place where Italian immigrants have settled.\n</scratchpad>\n<response>No</response>\n\nExample 2. User Input:\n<query>\nwhat is java programming good for\n</query>\n<passage>\nA Java program runs on any computer with a Java Runtime Environment, also known as a JRE, installed. A JRE is available for almost every type of computer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 PCs running Windows, Macintosh computers, Unix or Linux computers, huge mainframe computers, and even cell phones.\n</passage>\n\nExample 2. Agent Output:\n<scratchpad>\nThe passage talks about Java programs running on any computer with a Java Runtime Environment installed. This implies that Java programming is good for developing software that can run on any type of computer.\n</scratchpad>\n<response>Yes</response>",
